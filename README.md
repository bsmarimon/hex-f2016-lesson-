### HEX Lesson
This are the lesson files for the web design workshop for HEX, an event hosted by Innovative Design at UC Berkeley meant to introduce to the various disciples of design.

### Typography
Typography is a very important part of web design. It can communicate the identity of a site and bring out its personality, along with it making easy for users to digest content. Currently, Google hosts an enormous amount of fonts that you can use for free [here](https://fonts.google.com/). They give you potential pairings between fonts, and if anything, it's just fun to explore their site. This project currently uses the font family Lato, but feel free to change it. You can do so by going to the `index.html` file and modifying the link to the google font api.

### Color
Just as important as typography is color. For this lesson, I'm going to direct you to an array of [material design colors](https://www.materialui.co/colors). If you choose a row, the colors just seem to magically all fit together. This is especially helpful for us, since we're going to be color coding our schedules like ScheduleBuilder did (may it rest in peace). Try to find 4 or 5 colors that you like, and we'll play around with them.

### The Code
Woo! We're going to be focusing on the HTML & CSS for this project. We'll go over the javascript written in `main.js` briefly, but for the most part, it is trivial. The majority of our work will be done in `index.html` and `main.css`. We'll start with a bit of starter code, but you can also look at the finished code in `example.html` and `example.css`.

On another note, a fun function we're going to be using is the `calc()` operation in our CSS files. This allows us to compute a value, and then use that value in our CSS declarations. This will be helpful, since we're also going to be doing a bit of math to figure out how our schedule should line up.
